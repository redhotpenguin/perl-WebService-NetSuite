Revision history for Perl extension WebService::NetSuite.

0.03
    - Changed usage to use names instead of IDs [github/dbeusee]
    - Look up correct netsuite domain (datacenter) to use (netsuite.com, na1.netsuite.com, sandbox.netsuite.com, etc). Old usage still supported for backward
compatibility, but new usage is recommended.
    - Use more fully qualified namespaces so that things like ExpenseReport request can work.
    - Better error handling
    - Added options for debugging - send debug info to a file (NetSuite.dbg by default) including SOAP request and reply and some additional debug messages.
    - Allow add request to include attributes to the element (ExpenseReport record takes externalId element for instance).
